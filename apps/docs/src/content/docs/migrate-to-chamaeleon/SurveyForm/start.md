## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will step by step transfer a project with one page and a form to the chameleon framework

As a result, we will get a flexible form that can be customized both the position of the elements and their content

This will give you a good base on how to use Chameleon so that you can create more complex cases and more complex settings in your application.

## Example

This is our initial project, a simple form with predefined fields, we can't move or edit anything, just a form with data filled in

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/survey-form-base-3rszdt?file=%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2Fsurvey-form%2Fsurvey-form.tsx&embed=1"
  style="width:100%; height: 1000px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="survey-form-base"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
